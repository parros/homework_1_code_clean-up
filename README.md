# Homework 1 Code Clean-up

## Description

This repository is for consolidation of repetitive code, labeling improvements of html elements and organization of css. Making changes to a website can be hindered if the code is difficult to understand. The code for the [Horiseon website][1] should be shorter and easier to read through with these changes.
